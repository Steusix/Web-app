Welcome to the Weather Web App!

This app allows users to access current weather information for a given location. The app will request the user's location with their consent, and display the current temperature, feels like temperature, wind conditions, and weather conditions for that area. Users can also manually search for weather information for any location of their choosing.

To use the app, simply grant the app access to your location or enter a location manually. The app will then display the current weather information for that area.

Please note that the weather data is provided by a third-party API and may not be accurate or up-to-date. This app is for informational purposes only and should not be used for making important decisions.
